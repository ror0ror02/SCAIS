# SCAIS (Supreme Commander Artificial Intelligence System)
## Project Overview

**Description:**
VOLOv8 is a project integrating the YOLOv8 object detection model with a system similar to ChatGPT-4. The goal is to automatically detect objects in images and videos, extract their coordinates, and perform actions based on those coordinates. This project is being developed in a game environment similar to *Supreme Commander*, where AI will utilize object locations for decision-making.

**Key Features:**
- Object detection on images and videos.
- Extraction of object coordinates.
- Execution of actions based on the extracted coordinates (development in progress).

**Current Status:**
- [x] Model trained and validated on images and videos.
- [x] Object detection is working with high accuracy.
- [ ] Integration with game logic (in progress).
- [ ] Automating decision-making based on model data (in progress).

**Future Plans:**
- Enhance the accuracy and speed of object detection.
- Full integration with game systems.
- Add capabilities for dynamic analysis and real-time actions.
